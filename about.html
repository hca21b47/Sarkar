Our Story

ABC Printing Company opened for business in 1963 as ABC Business Forms, Inc. <br> The founder, William Strauss, began with business forms, letterheads and envelopes, labels, and some color work.
<br> Current owners RJ and Steve Strauss, the founders two sons, took over our company in 1983.<br>


ABC Business Forms, Inc.
 (as it was then known) was originally located at 5481 N Milwaukee Ave., Chicago, IL.<br> The company later moved to 5778 N Elston Ave and was there for nearly 30 years before moving to 5654 N Elston Ave.<br>

Soon after taking over management of the business, both brothers decided to change its name as ABC was becoming much more than a “forms” company.<br>
<br> ABC Business Forms, Inc. had served the company well, but Steve and RJ wanted to create a more relative brand without losing ties to our past.<br> 
They chose ABC Printing Co. 
and began marketing the company under that name in 1985.<br>

Under RJ's leadership, ABC Printing Co.
 was proud to have made Printing Magazines "Top 100" printing firms nationally during the 1980's, 90's and to this day.<br>
 ABC has been on Inc Magazine’s Top 5000 Fastest-Growing private companies in America.<br>
 Most of our success and notoriety was a direct result of our fast turnaround time, quality service, and depth of product line.<br>
 Anything that could be branded, we could print.

At a time when most printing firms took three to four weeks to print an envelope or brochure order, ABC would commonly print them in 1-2 weeks.<br>
 Our quality, diversity, and personalized service is what our clients want and deserve.<br>

It seems like every company talks about the importance of customer service, but one of the lasting cornerstones of our business is the way our customers feel about working with us.<br>
Our dependability and reliability have become renowned. 
When you work fast, rarely miss a deadline, have fair prices, and treat people with dignity and respect, it's hard not to experience the kind of growth that we have seen in the last 60 years.<br>
 That's what we do at ABC Printing Company, and we currently have over 2,500 active customers nationwide.

We humbly invite you to consider using us the next time your company needs printing and or promotional items.<br>
 There's a reason we have kept many customers for 20 years or longer, and we would love the opportunity to demonstrate that for you on your next printing or promotional goods project.<br>
 You see, we do things very differently than the other printers in our community, and we believe we can provide the best all-around experience for you if you'll give us the chance to!<br>

If you would like to talk to one of our customer service representatives, please call 773-774-8282.<br>
 We are happy to discuss how we can help your business succeed and prosper. Feel free to ask for RJ Strauss, the owner himself, anytime, for any reason at all.<br>
